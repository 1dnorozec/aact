  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, safety, usability and tolerability trial of
      Strontium 90 (Sr90) beta radiation episcleral brachytherapy in subjects receiving aflibercept
      therapy pro re nata (PRN) for the treatment of early neovascular Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (nAMD) lesions. Secondary aims are to observe clinical outcomes of area of
      leakage, sub-retinal fluid, lesion size, visual acuity, and anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (anti-VEGF) treatment burden.

      Subjects will receive a single brachytherapy treatment and 52-weeks of follow-up.

          -  Documented continued care for nAMD since diagnosis

          -  Patients must have demonstrated clinical or OCT/angiographic evidence that, in the
             investigator's opinion, requires treatment with anti-VEGF therapy.

          -  BCVA 20/40 - 20/200 Snellen equivalent in study eye

          -  Actively leaking CNV as determined by FA

          -  Ability to undergo diagnostic tests and surgical interventions

          -  Ability to follow instructions and complete the trial including all scheduled visits
             and follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of child-bearing potential (defined as &lt; 2 years post-menopausal)

             Fluorescein angiography

          -  Presence of subretinal fibrosis in the study eye

          -  Existing Retinal Pigment Epithelial tear

          -  Previous treatment (excluding vitamins) for nAMD in the study eye other than

          -  Anticipate a change to the anti-VEGF agent during the conduct of the study

          -  Previous intraocular surgery in study eye other than for uncomplicated
             phacoemulsification cataract extraction

          -  Other clinically significant ocular co-morbidity including, but not limited to, optic
             glaucoma, optic neuropathy of any cause, maculopathy / retinopathy of any cause other
             than nAMD, and scleritis

          -  Refractive error of - 6D or greater (spherical equivalent) or demonstrated myopic
             degeneration

          -  Media opacity sufficient to preclude adequate fundoscopy, OCT or angiography

          -  Uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g. controlled hypertension is acceptable)

          -  Type I or type II diabetes mellitus

          -  Clinically significant previous radiation to the eye

          -  Unable to discontinue anticoagulation or dual anti-platelet therapy for 7 days before
             and after the study intervention.

          -  Patient unsuitable for IV or local anesthesia

          -  Any contraindication to anti-VEGF, fluorescein, topical and local anesthetics, topical
             antiseptics, or topical antibiotics to be used during the study

          -  Active ocular or periocular infection or intraocular inflammation

          -  Only eligible eye is the best seeing eye

          -  Any condition which, in the investigators' opinion, would conflict or otherwise
             prevent the subject from complying with the required procedures, schedule or other
             study conduct
