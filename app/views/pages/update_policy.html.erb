<h2 id="background">Database Update Policy and Schedule</h2>

<h4>In Summary...</h4>

<ul class='regularDisplay'>
<li>The live cloud-based database is completely refreshed on the first day of every month. The process begins at midnight and takes about 15 hours.</li>
<li>A process runs every night at midnight to apply incremental changes to the live database.</li>
<li>After every database update, a static copy of the refreshed database and a set of pipe-delimited files containing the content of database tables are published to this <a target='_blank' href='https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/download'>website & made available for download</a>.</li>
<li>Static database copies & pipe-delimited files created on the first day of the month (after the complete refresh) are archived and remain permanently available for download.</li>
<li>Static database copies & pipe-delimited files created on other days of the month (after incremental updates) remain available for download until the end of the month.</li>
</ul>

<h4>In Detail...</h4>

<ul class='regularDisplay'>
<li>
   <p>A full refresh of the database is scheduled to run at midnight on the first day of every month. This process takes 15-20 hours. The database remains available during this time; however it must be locked down for about 5 minutes at the end when it's restored from the version of the database that was refreshed. This process uses the <a target='_blank' href='https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download#DownloadAllData'>ClinicalTrials.gov API</a> to retrieve all data.</p>

   <p>The monthly full refresh is performed because ClinicalTrials.gov occasionally needs to merge studies that have been identified as duplicates. The incremental/nightly load process cannot detect & delete studies that have been eliminated due to duplication removal, so we run a complete refresh to ensure that AACT accurately reflect what's in ClinicalTrials.gov. This process uses the <a target='_blank' href='https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/rss'>ClinicalTrials.gov RSS Feed</a> to retrieve studies that have been added or changed.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>A nightly, incremental update is scheduled to run each night at midnight; it takes about one and a half hours to complete. As with the full refresh, the database remains available for use throughout most of the process (excluding the 5 minutes it takes to restore from a background database).</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>The postgreSQL pg_dump command is used to create a static copy of the database every night after the update. It is zipped up with the current documentation (the data dictionary, database schema and current, related information from the National Library of Medicine), and made available for download <a target='_blank' href='https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/download'>here</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>A set of files containing pipe-delimited content of the tables is also published on the website after the monthly refresh (There was a glitch this month, however and it didn't get created until today.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
