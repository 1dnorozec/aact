  <h3 class="stepName">Install <i>PostgreSQL</i> Database Platform</h3>

</div>

<p>The standard <i>PostgreSQL</i> installation includes a number of nice tools, but if you intend to just access the public AACT database hosted in the cloud, the only tool you need is pSQL. If on the other hand, you'd like to download your own static copy of AACT to use on your local machine, you'll need the full postgreSQL package including the tools to create and populate the database (createdb & pg_restore). These tools are mentioned throughout the documentation provided on this site; they should all be available on your local machine once you install the PostgreSQL package.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AACT is currently running on version <%= ENV['DB_VERSION'] %> of PostgreSQL; it's recommended you install this version or higher. Refer to <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/download/' target='_blank'>PostgreSQL Downloads</a> for free software and installation instructions.</p>
