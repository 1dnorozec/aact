 <h3>AACT 3.1.2 <i>(May 21, 2018)</i></h3>

  h5>Added Pending_Results Table</h5>
  <p>On May 9, 2018, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) added data about 'pending results' to the ClinicalTrials.gov API. A <i>Pending_Results</i> table has been added to the AACT database to present this new information.</p>

  <p>NLM provides result submission date(s) for studies that have results awaiting quality control (QC) review. The results themselves are not publicly posted until the review is complete. The dates for three types of events related to results submission are reported in the Pending_Results table:</p>
  <ul class='regularDisplay'>

    <li><i>Submission:</i> The date(s) that study results were submitted to NLM for QC review.</li>
    <li><i>Submission Canceled:</i> The date(s) that such submissions were canceled by the data provider. (Note: this value is set to "Unknown" if the cancellation occurred before 05/08/2018 when this data started to be collected).</li>
    <li><i>Returned:</i>  The date(s) that study results were returned to the data provider because they required modification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The NLM reports that the following updates occur to this information when a study passes the quality control review:</p>
  <ul class='regularDisplay'>

    <li><i>Study.results_first_submitted_date</i> is populated with the earliest 'submitted date' from Pending_Results.</li>
    <li><i>Study.results_first_submitted_qc_date</i> is populated with the submitted date of the version of results that passed QC.</li>
    <li>Result tables (<i>Reported_Events, Outcomes, Baseline_Measurements</i>, etc.) are populated with the result information that passed QC.</li>
    <li>All rows for the study with reviewed/approved results are removed from the <i>Pending_Events</i> table.</li>
  </ul>


  <h5>Added Documents Table</h5>
  <p>The ClinicalTrials.gov API provides information about & links to documents related to a study. AACT now saves this information to the table: <i>Documents</i>. NLM provides the following information about these data:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/html/images/info/public.xsd"><p class='quotedText'>The full study protocol and statistical analysis plan must be uploaded as part of results information submission, for studies with a Primary Completion Date on or after January 18, 2017. The protocol and statistical analysis plan may be optionally uploaded before results information submission and updated with new versions, as needed. Informed consent forms may optionally be uploaded at any time.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Please refer to <a href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/results_definitions.html#DocumentUpload' target='_blank'>NLM Results Data Element Definitions</a> for more detailed information about study documents.</p>

  <h5>Deprecated Date Attributes Removed from ClinicalTrials.gov; Also Removed from AACT</h5>
  <p>On May 3, 2018, NLM posted this comment to their API schema documentation:</p>
  <div class='quotedText'> <blockquote cite="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/html/images/info/public.xsd"><p class='innerQuotedText'>As promised in 08/30/2017 entry above, old redundant date names have been retired and their tags removed.  Please update systems to stop using the date on the left in favor of the date on the right.
    <table>
      <tr><th>obsolete tag</th><th>replacement tag</th></tr>
      <tr><td width='400'>&lt;firstreceived_date&gt;</td><td>&lt;study_first_submitted&gt;</td></tr>
      <tr><td width='400'>&lt;firstreceived_results_date&gt;</td><td>&lt;results_first_submitted&gt;</td></tr>
      <tr><td width='400'>&lt;firstreceived_results_disposition_date&gt;</td><td>&lt;disposition_first_submitted&gt;</td></tr>
      <tr><td width='400'>&lt;lastchanged_date&gt;</td><td>&lt;last_update_submitted&gt;</td></tr>
    </table>
    </p></blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>All these date attributes are stored in the Studies table. On January 22, 2018, the obsolete date tags/columns were identified as deprecated and new columns were added that mimic the new labels defined by NLM. The removed columns are:</p>
   <table class='regularDisplay'>
     <tr><td><i>first_received_date</i></td>                  <td><i>study_first_submitted_date</i></tr>
     <tr><td><i>first_received_results_date</i></td>          <td><i>results_first_submitted_date</i></tr>
     <tr><td><i>first_received_results_disposit_date</i></td> <td><i>disposition_first_submitted_date</i></tr>
     <tr><td><i>last_changed_date</i></td>                    <td><i>last_update_submitted_date</i></tr>
   </table>

   <p>With these release, the deprecated columns have been removed.</p>

  <h5>Update Automated Test Scripts</h5>
  <p>Since ClinicalTrials.gov has made several changes to the API (adding new tags; removing deprecated tags), we needed to update the sample studies we use to run automated test scripts so that they correctly reflect the current structure of the ClinicalTrials.gov API. The latest version of all studies used in automated tests were downloaded, and test scripts were updated to accomodate the changes found.</p>

  <h5>Update SAS Connection Documentation</h5>
  <p>Inclusion of the database password was missing and the fonts were 'off'.</p>

  <h5>Automate Process to Save Tables to Schema Named: ctgov</h5>
  <p></p>

  <h5>Email User Restoration SQL to AACT Administrators</h5>
  <p>To ensure we are able to recover user account information if we need to, we now dump the SQL that can be used to recreate user-related tables and database account information to files and then email the files to AACT Administrators.</p>

  <h5>Collect Enumeration Data Twice a Month</h5>
  <p></p>

  <h5>Prefix Every Log Line with the Date/Time Stamp</h5>
  <p></p>
