    <p>Providing the public with direct, query-able access to a database in the cloud is not a common model and we have yet to determine how well it will serve hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users, however AWS cloud services provides the most promising alternative for scalable solutions. Another notable challenge has been the time required (~15 hours) to load 220,000+ studies. With recent regulatory changes, it’s likely the amount of data in ClinicalTrials.gov will grow at a faster rate; therefore CTTI continues to investigate ways to
improve performance and reliability.</p>

  <p>A beta version was released on October 1, 2016. Previous AACT users will be asked to test the new version and their advice/suggestions will be reviewed and implemented through the end of 2016. An official launch is scheduled for January 1, 2017, just in time for HHS ‘final rules’ to take effect. </p>
